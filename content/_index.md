Guy de Maupassant wrote more than 300 short stories. English readers have access to good translations of maybe 30 to 50 of them, while many of the rest are either still untranslated or available only in century-old public domain editions, often abridged or bowdlerized. 

This site documents my attempt to study the stories thoroughly in the original French, to translate at least some of them into English — beginning with some of the lesser-known ones — and to share what I find and the computational tools I've built in the process.
